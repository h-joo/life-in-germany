# How do I know if I fit well in Germany? :thinking:

All of the following sections are discussing about something about a subjective matter. Although I'm trying to be genuine on what I write down, everyone's experience is unique and my reference point is what I had exprienced in South Korea, thus cannot represent what everyone would feel when you arrive, as you would feel different for everything, and the matter only is how different your experience or feeling should be. So please try to take what I wrote down here with a grain of salt here. 

I have seem people who lived in their own countries for most of their lives (including me) tend not to understand the difference between cultures and systems before they actually experienced it, so fantasizing the life in other countries might be a risk that you might not want to take. But even so, I'll still try to be as subjective as I can be 🙂

## Weather in Germany :thinking:

Depends on your percention of what a good weather is, but I haven't seen much people that says they like German weather. There's a saying in German : "Es gibt kein schlechtes Wetter nur schlechte Kleidung" meaning that there's no bad weather, and only exists the unfitting outfit. I've lived in a country with clear sky most of the year, and when it rains it pours, and in winter it's freezing cold but very dry. I've never understood the concept of appreciating the sun before moving to Germany, as the sun was something that can be taken as granted. 

But after living in Germany for some years, I've changed as well. I started to appreciate the sun, go out and stay under the sun when I have the chance. When I was in the first year living in Berlin, I was so surprised that people just go out and tan naked under the sun. I've lived in West, North east, and South of Germany but in those different regions, one thing common is that you will always appreciate sun to some degree. But it's not really pouring when it's raining, it's mostly cloudly and drizzling most of the time. 

Over the year the temperature is usually between -5 ~ 32 degrees, and there were few Summer which went really hot. You usually wouldn't find air conditioners in Germany because it isn't really that hot in Summer, but also the electicity is quite expensive and also people do care a lot about sustainable life here.

Not something about weathers directly, but something about sun, if you have lived in somewhere in the latitude near Spain or Portugal, you wouldn't have issues with this that much, but Summer has longer days and Winter has shorter. In Winter, sunset can be around 3:30 pm, and by the time to go back home after work, it's already pretty dark. This can be very depressing and many people suffers from Winter blues. So many of my friends travels South during Winter, to be in a warmer and a sunny weather.

## Traveling :thinking:

There's lots of countries that we shares a border with. To the west, there's Netherlands, Belgium and France, and to the East are Poland, Czech Republic,  to the south there's Austria Switzerland and finally to the north we have Denmark. As a person who lived in a country which is like an Island, this is a great benefit to have - being able to travel to nearby countries by car or by train or even buses. 

If you haven't been in Europe, there's simply just too many places that you can travel either by land or by plane.

## German culture and society :thinking:

I thought I could write about this, but decided that you really cannot Generalize German culture in few sentences, since Germany is also a very-big-diverse country which have different culture in different regions. Also younger people are even more further away from what people consider as stereotypical German which are the people that I meet more often.

But if you want to learn in depth, there are lots of youtube channels which talk about different cultures including German. One channel I often watch is [EasyGerman](https://www.youtube.com/@EasyGerman), you can search specifically for German culture as a keyword if you want to learn.

## Strong labor protection laws and less working hours :thinking:

This is one of the greatest benefits of working in Germany - the strong labor protection and less working hours. Some companies do 35 hours per week, and some upto usually 40 hours. (Citation needed) I heard the maximum hours that you can work in a week is 48 hours, but I've never seen any software company doing this. The minimum vacation days per year is 24 days for people working 6 days and 20 days for 5 days workers, and me and many of friends I've seen has 30 days. 
 
When you or your family gets sick, you can take a paid sick leave (at least for the software companies that I've seen) easily, without having to worry that it might affect your performance evaluation or getting fired. I worried too much in the beginning that it might affect my employement, but looking back, that was just being too paranoid due to the culture that I came from. I think it's a great system to make people rest, when they genuinely need it. 

Labor protection is strong, it is not impossible to fire people but is still difficult to do so, I'm not a labor law expert so I'm not going to go into too much details, (Citation Needed) but generally the court is in favor of the workers, so the companies try to avoid going to the court for those reasons.

## Bureaucracy in Germany :thinking:

## High income tax :thinking:

Income tax is high in Germany, it can range from [14% to 45%](https://www.iamexpat.de/expat-info/taxation/german-tax-system), and if you're not married you'll most likely pay 42% as a software engineer including your contribution to your pension your health insurance and your unemployment insurance. So the amount of money on your contract is pretty far away from what you will have in your bank account. If you get bonues, the tax on bonuses is higher than your regular income.

If you're a couple, you can set your tax class differntly such that one pays 30% and the other pays 50%, which I feel decourages the other to work, but it's the way how it is. 

So overall, I think if you want to make lots of savings, Germany might not be the best place for you, but if you agree your contribution as the income tax to the society is worth the cost and being used well, it might be a place for you.

## Healthcare system :thinking:

Being healthy is an important factor of you being happy, and I guess it's worth mentioning how I feel about healthcare system in Germany. 

To have an overall summary, I think Germany generally has a good healthcare system. The coverage of the public health insurance is really broad. Most of the time you wouldn't have to pay anything to see a doctor, and for medication you usually will be paying 5 Euros or more depending on the coverage but I feel this is really not that much. 

Due to the coverage being huge, the system lean towards avoiding overtreatment because it only costs more. And I'm not sure what the exact cause for here, but I'm guessing the huge coverage also contributes to this, which is, you have to wait very long to see a doctor for many cases
