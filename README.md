This is a documentation-style repository to provide an idea of what it's like to live in germany and also the process of migration for **tech people** who wants to settle in (or try out living in) Germany. The owner of this repository has studied computer science and been working as a software engineer in Germany for quite a while, and has struggled a lot and still in the contiunation of struggling as many things are just different. There are many good channels that you can ask for questions regarding life in Germany, but I feel I still haven't found a place where the whole process from decision making to finally settling down is organized, thus triggered me to create this repository.

The whole doc is targeted for people who've started to think about moving to Germany, and maybe some people who started to settle in Germany upto 3-6 months maximum. After that I think you should have learned enough about the life in Germany so you shouldn't usually be needing these.

I've annotated each section with two different icons to tell whether something is discussing about a subjective or an objective matter. 

1. :information_source: Things that can be objective (e.g. the process of getting a visa, getting registered and etc.)
1. :thinking: Talking about things that are subjective or something based on personal experience without much data to back up.

The name of the repo followed the name of the Naturalization test ["Leben In Deutschland"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einb%C3%BCrgerungstest)
